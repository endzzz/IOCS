These files are used in this project: The spatial-temporal distribution and variation of GOCI-derived suspended sediment along coastal
water induced by a typhoon.
These code are used to do exponential regression, and find out how long it takes to recover to the initial state.
exponential form: TSM_concentration = a*exp(-b*time)+c
Also, I wrote another scrips to plot the result of each pixel to make sure the results are reasonable.
